/*
A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.
it does same work like xml but it is easy to read,write and manipulate data.
data from server is always in string format so we use JSON.parse()
When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string.JSON.stringify() is used.
Stands for javascript object notation;
it has (number,string,boolean,null,object,array)data types
JSON.stringify() is used to convert an object to a string while JSON.parse()
is used to revese to object.
